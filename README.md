## Skills Utilized

* API connectivity
    * We connected 3 APIs together to diplay trail information, weather forecast, 
    and a interactive map.
* Bulma CSS framework
    * Utilizing the bulma CSS framework we created a mobile responsive application
    that displays a clean UI.
* JavaScript Logic
    * Created Javascript logic to generate HTML elements where necessary instead
    of relying on HTML hard coded elements.
